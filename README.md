# Big-Data-Analysis-on-Retail-Items-HUE(Hive)
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline using Apache Hive on Cloudera Hue. We use a Sales dataset (CSV) to perform data ingestion, cleaning, and analysis inside Hive. The project highlights how Hive simplifies SQL-based queries for big data stored in HDFS.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Cloudera VM – Big Data sandbox environment
HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) – Storage layer
Hive on Hue – SQL-based querying engine
CSV Dataset (Sales data) – Input data for analysis

✅ Results

Cleaned and analyzed sales data in Hive using SQL queries.
Extracted top-selling products, least-selling products, and city-based sales trends.
Converted raw CSV into structured Hive tables for analysis.

Learning Outcomes
Hands-on experience with HiveQL (SQL for Hadoop).
Practical knowledge of Cloudera Hue for data analysis.
Exposure to working with structured/unstructured data in HDFS.

Future Enhancements

Automate daily ingestion using Hive partitions (by Month, City).
Integrate with Power BI/Tableau for business dashboards.
Add user-defined functions (UDFs) for custom data transformations.

This project showcases how Hive can be used for big data analytics in a real-world business scenario using sales datasets.
